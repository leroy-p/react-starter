# Getting Started with React Starter

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and uses [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

## Available Scripts

In the root directory, run `npm install`\
Create in the package directory (`/packages/react-app`) a new file named `.env` and copy `.env.example` content in it.

In the package directory (`/packages/react-app`), you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
